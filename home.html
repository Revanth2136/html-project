    <p>
     <p>1.What is HTML?<br></p>
       <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images to display web pages in browser.   <br></p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>2.What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?<br></p>
          <p>HTML is flexible with syntax, while XHTML is stricter and follows XML rules.
XHTML requires well-formed code (like closed tags and lowercase elements), making it more rigid than HTML.  <br></p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>3.What is the difference between inline and block-level elements in HTML?<br></p>
         <p>
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary (e.g., <span>, <a>).
Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available (e.g., <div>, <p>).  <br>
         </p>
        </p>
      <p>
        <p>4.What is the difference between id and class in HTML?<br></p>
        <p>The id attribute uniquely identifies a single HTML element and is used once per page.
The class attribute can be shared by multiple elements to apply common styles or behavior.   <br></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>5.What are HTML input types?<br></p>
        <p>HTML input types specify the kind of data an element accepts, like text, numbers, or dates.
Examples include text, password, email, checkbox, radio, date, and submit.</p>
